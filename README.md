# Track Employees - SQL
 
## Description
 
This project is run in the command line using inquirer, console.table, and mysql2. It allows the user to add to and update tables in a mysql database that hold information about a company and it's employees. This information includes the company's departments, the employee's personal information, etc. This system is extremely useful for keeping track of employees as they join the company, leave the company, or are promoted. It can also keep track of the different departments in the company, the base salary for different job roles, and much more. It solves the problem of using cumbersome spreadsheets or pen and paper to keep track of your company's information.
